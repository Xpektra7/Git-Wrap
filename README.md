# GitWrap: Your GitHub Year-in-Review Dashboard**


GitWrap is a React & Tailwind single-page application that generates a personalized "year in review" summary for any GitHub user. It surfaces key statistics such as commits, pull requests, issues, repository creations, most active repositories, top languages, stars given/received, and more. You can start with REST API calls and later enhance with GraphQL.
